# Security-Threat-Detection-via-Cloud-SIEM

In this  Project we are going to create a honeypot actually which will be just a Virtual machine in the Cloud. and we will expose that honeypot or that virtual machine on the Internet . and we are going to configure the logs forwarding (Log analytics)  which will forward the security related logs to the central repository , and then we will connect that repository to the  Cloud SIEM (Microsoft Sentinel) . and from that siem we can query the logs using the KQL.
